I received the master’s degree in material science in 2006 at École nationale des ponts et chaussées, and the PhD degree in image processing applied to material science in 2009 from Ecole Polytechnique. After a post-doc in the Australian National University,
   I have been a founder of a start-up  dedicated to a new language called [Cameleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameleon_(programming_language))  and a second one for  [character 
   recognition](http://www.alphanumeric-vision.com/).  After a mathematics aggregation in 2016, I have been a teacher in high-school.  
  Since September 2018, I am an associated professor on computer science at [Yncréa Ouest/ISEN Nantes-France](https://isen-nantes.fr/).
  My research interests include data science, machine learning,  image processing and are conducted in [L@bISEN – Yncréa Ouest/AI-ED Departement/LSL Team](https://isen-brest.fr/recherche/)
