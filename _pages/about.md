I received the master’s degree in material science in 2006 at École nationale des ponts et chaussées, and the PhD degree in image processing applied to material science in 2009 from Ecole Polytechnique. After a post-doc in the Australian National University,
   I have been a founder of a start-up  dedicated to a new language called [Cameleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameleon_(programming_language))  and a second one for  [character 
   recognition](http://www.alphanumeric-vision.com/).  After a mathematics aggregation in 2016, I have been a teacher in high-school.  

I was an associated professor on computer science at [Yncréa Ouest/ISEN Nantes-France](https://isen-nantes.fr/).
My research interests include data science, machine learning and  image processing and were conducted in [L@bISEN – Yncréa Ouest/AI-ED Departement/LSL Team](https://isen-brest.fr/recherche/).



Since January 2020, I am head of Mathematics department at ESPE of Université de la Nouvelle-Calédonie.  
Since January 1, 2026, I am the founder of [CommeUnJeu](https://commeunjeu.org), a digital-first mathematics publishing platform that separates content creation from instructional delivery so the same coherent learning experience works on paper, desktop, and mobile. Its unified lesson data architecture keeps notation, vocabulary, and progression consistent across grade levels.

CommeUnJeu
==========
CommeUnJeu is a digital-first mathematics publishing platform built around a simple conviction: high-quality math teaching should not be limited by tooling, formatting constraints, or fragmented resources. The platform separates **content creation** from **instructional delivery** to serve both classroom teaching and autonomous learning across **paper, desktop, and mobile**.

At its core, CommeUnJeu is a unified lesson data architecture—not a loose library of resources. Lessons are structured as connected objects (definitions, properties, methods, examples, exercises, and pedagogical intent) authored within one coherent thread across grade levels. This ensures:

* consistent vocabulary and notation,
* explicit prerequisites,
* intentional progression from year to year,
* continuity that supports long-term mastery.
