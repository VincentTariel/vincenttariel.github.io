I received the master’s degree in material science in 2006 at École nationale des ponts et chaussées, and the PhD degree in image processing applied to material science in 2009 from Ecole Polytechnique. After a post-doc in the Australian National University,
   I have been a founder of a start-up  dedicated to a new language called [Cameleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameleon_(programming_language))  and a second one for  [character 
   recognition](http://www.alphanumeric-vision.com/).  After a mathematics aggregation in 2016, I have been a teacher in high-school.  

I was an associated professor on computer science at [Yncréa Ouest/ISEN Nantes-France](https://isen-nantes.fr/).
My research interests include data science, machine learning and  image processing and were conducted in [L@bISEN – Yncréa Ouest/AI-ED Departement/LSL Team](https://isen-brest.fr/recherche/).

I was head of Mathematics department at ESPE of Université de la Nouvelle-Calédonie.  

Since January 1, 2026, I’ve been building [CommeUnJeu](https://commeunjeu.org), a math publishing platform where I create all lessons, exercises, and detailed corrections from kindergarten to high school. Everything is designed as one coherent learning path, so concepts connect clearly from grade to grade, with well-crafted exercises that develop practical problem-solving skills.
