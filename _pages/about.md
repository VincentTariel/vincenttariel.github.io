I’m a mathematician and machine learning engineer focused on turning rigorous methods into useful, well-designed learning and software products.

I earned a master’s degree (2006) from **École nationale des ponts et chaussées** and a PhD (2009) in **image processing** from **École Polytechnique**. After a postdoctoral position at **The Australian National University**, I co-founded two startups: one around the programming language **Cameleon**, and another in **optical character recognition** and document understanding.

In 2016, I passed the **agrégation de mathématiques**, and I have taught mathematics at high-school level, with a strong emphasis on structured reasoning, problem-solving, and progression design. I was also an associate professor in computer science at **Yncréa Ouest / ISEN Nantes (France)**, and my research work in **data science**, **machine learning**, and **image processing** was conducted within **L@bISEN – Yncréa Ouest / AI-ED Department / LSL Team**.

I later served as Head of the Mathematics Department at **INSPE, Université de la Nouvelle-Calédonie**, where I worked on curriculum coherence and teacher training, bridging mathematical rigor with classroom reality.

Since **January 1, 2026**, I’ve been building **CommeUnJeu**, a digital-first mathematics publishing platform where I create **all lessons, exercises, and detailed solutions** from kindergarten to high school. The content is designed as a single coherent learning path: concepts connect explicitly across grades, and the exercise design builds durable skills—especially practical problem-solving and mathematical thinking.
