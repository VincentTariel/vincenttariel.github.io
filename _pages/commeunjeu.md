# CommeUnJeu — A coherent math curriculum from kindergarten to high school

**Project link:** https://commeunjeu.org

CommeUnJeu is my long-term project: a mathematics publishing platform where I author **the full sequence of lessons, exercises, and detailed corrections** from **kindergarten to high school**. The goal is simple: give learners and teachers a **single, coherent learning path** where ideas (“*savoir*”) connect clearly across years, and where practice builds real problem-solving skills (“*savoir-faire*”).

## Why this project exists

Math resources are often fragmented: worksheets from one place, explanations from another, exercises with different notation, and progressions that don’t quite align. CommeUnJeu is built to solve that problem by designing the curriculum as **one connected journey**, not a collection of isolated chapters.

## What makes CommeUnJeu different

### 1) One authorial thread, one conceptual map
All content is created within the same didactic framework, so:
- vocabulary stays consistent,
- notation doesn’t drift,
- prerequisites are explicit,
- progression is intentional from year to year.

### 2) Lessons + practice + corrections (not just “resources”)
Each notion comes with:
- clear explanations and examples,
- exercises chosen to develop technique and reasoning,
- **corrections that teach**, not just answers.

### 3) Digital-first, multi-format by design
CommeUnJeu separates **content creation** from **instructional delivery**, so the same material can be used coherently across:
- **paper** (printable documents),
- **desktop**,
- **mobile**.

## The vision

Mathematics is cumulative: early concepts should be built to support later mastery (algebra, functions, modeling, proof). CommeUnJeu treats the curriculum as a **longitudinal dataset**—a structured body of lessons that remains coherent across grade levels, so learning becomes continuous, not patchwork.

If you’re a teacher, a student, or simply curious about how coherent math instruction can be designed end-to-end, CommeUnJeu is my answer.
